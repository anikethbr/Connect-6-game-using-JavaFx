Bugs fixed, An improvised version of Connect Four game.
About the Game: Connect Six is a two-player connection game in which the players first choose a color and then take turns dropping colored discs from the top into a ten-column, eight-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the next available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of six of one's own discs. Connect Six is a solved game. The first player can always win by playing the right moves.
